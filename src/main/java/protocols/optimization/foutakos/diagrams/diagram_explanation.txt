We noticed that Foutakos simply sending the computed number of neighbors
to the overlay everytime it computed could create an instability problem, because the numbers could be
for example 3,4,3,4,3,4, etc. (this is especially bad on hyparview).

Then, we decided to try a more complex approach to minimize instability (diagram ..._complex_approach.png).
However, when resest had a high margin and low conf. interval, we still noticed instability in some cases
(e.g, 4,6,4,...).

Then, we decided to always send the average of the last 5 nodes, to minimize instability.
